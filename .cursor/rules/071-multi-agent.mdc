# Topologies

- Choose among: single-agent w/tools, supervisor-worker, hierarchical, or debate/consensus patterns.
- Keep each agent single-responsibility with minimal tool surface.

# Coordination

- Define shared message schema; include role, tool invocations, partial results, and costs.
- Avoid unbounded fan-out; apply queues/bulkheads; require human-in-the-loop for high-risk actions.

# Determinism

- Use explicit prompts/system directives per agent; version prompts; record model/params/seeds.
