# Policy

- All config via env vars; no plaintext secrets in repo; support `.env` only for local dev.
- Separate settings classes per bounded context (API, DB, Cache, LLM, VectorStore).
- Validate at startup; crash fast on missing required settings.
- Settings live under `infra/configs/` and are injected via DI providers.

# Environments

- Profiles: local/dev/staging/prod; forbid accidental prod defaults; require explicit feature flags.
- Keep environment-specific overrides in deployment layer; application reads via settings only.
