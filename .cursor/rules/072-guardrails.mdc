# Validation & Safety

- Validate input/output against Pydantic schemas; reject or repair before downstream use.
- Apply content safety, PII detection/redaction, topic constraints, and tool allowlists.

# Runtime

- Run guardrails inline for synchronous flows; use streaming validation for token streams when available.
- Log violations with trace IDs; never leak raw PII in logs.
