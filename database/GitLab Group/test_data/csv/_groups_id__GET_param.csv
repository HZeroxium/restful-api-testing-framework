3,"{""id"": -1, ""with_projects"": true}",4xx,"id=-1 is a negative integer; while not explicitly forbidden, negative IDs are not realistic for resource identifiers and violate real-world expectations."
4,"{""id"": 2147483649}",4xx,"id=2147483649 exceeds the typical 32-bit integer range; while not explicitly forbidden, such large values are not realistic for resource identifiers."
