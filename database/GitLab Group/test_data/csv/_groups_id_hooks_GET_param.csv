1,"{""id"": 60}",2xx,id=60 is a valid integer and matches the concrete group ID from the producer endpoint.
2,"{""id"": 60}",2xx,llm_success_ignore_optional
3,"{""id"": 60}",2xx,id=60 is a valid integer from dependency context and satisfies 'type=integer' for path parameter.
4,"{""id"": -1}",4xx,"id=-1 is negative, violating the typical positive integer constraint for IDs."
5,"{""id"": ""abc""}",4xx,"id='abc' is not parseable as integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
6,"{""id"": 0}",4xx,"id=0 is not a realistic positive integer for a group ID, violating typical ID constraints."
7,"{""id"": 2147483649}",4xx,"id=2147483649 exceeds the 32-bit signed integer maximum, violating 'type=integer' and realistic ID bounds."
8,"{""id"": ""abc""}",4xx,"id='abc' is not parseable as integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
9,"{""id"": 0}",4xx,id=0 is a boundary value often reserved for invalid IDs and may violate implicit domain constraints for resource IDs.
10,"{""id"": -1}",4xx,id=-1 is negative and violates the implicit constraint that IDs must be positive integers.
11,"{""id"": 3.14}",4xx,"id=3.14 is a float, not an integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."

13,"{""id"": ""123456""}",4xx,One or more fields deliberately violate the spec (4xx).
