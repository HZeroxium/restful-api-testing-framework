1,"{""id"": 1001, ""sha"": ""main""}",2xx,UNRESOLVABLE FOR 2XX DUE TO MISSING CONTEXT: No concrete project ID available from dependency endpoint /projects; cannot fabricate arbitrary ID.
2,"{""id"": ""abc"", ""sha"": ""main""}",4xx,"id='abc' is not parseable as integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
3,"{""id"": -5}",4xx,"id=-5 is a negative integer; while no explicit minimum is set, negative IDs are not realistic for project IDs."
4,"{""id"": 0}",4xx,One or more fields deliberately violate the spec (4xx).
5,"{""id"": 3.14}",4xx,"id=3.14 is a float, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
6,"{""id"": ""abc"", ""sha"": ""main""}",4xx,"id='abc' is not parseable as integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
7,"{""id"": 0}",4xx,One or more fields deliberately violate the spec (4xx).
8,"{""id"": -1, ""sha"": ""feature-branch""}",4xx,"id=-1 is negative, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter; project IDs must be positive integers."
9,"{""id"": 2147483649}",4xx,id=2147483649 exceeds typical 32-bit integer range; may violate implementation limits for path parameter.
10,"{""id"": 1.5}",4xx,"id=1.5 is not an integer, violating 'type=integer' for path parameter."
