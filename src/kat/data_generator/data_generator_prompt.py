GET_EXPLANATION_PROMPT = """The below is the endpoint's definition in the Swagger Specification:
{endpoint_data}

Relevant referenced schemas:
{ref_data}

Based on the above information, please indicate the detailed contraints of the parameters and/or request body (if any) that should be considered before sending to the endpoint to get a response. This would be useful in case of understanding the endpoint's functionality and/or testing it, as well as know which conditions that the value of the fields should meet in order not to violate/or deliberately violate to create high-coverage-rate dataset. 

Below format is recommended to generated a typical response:
<begin>
Some constraints:
- <constraint 1>
- ...
</end>

For each <constraint> above, you have to give explanation about how the value should be created to variate different levels of complexity and potential adjustments to yield errors. This Constraints section plays a crucial role in the quality of the response.

IMPORTANT FOR BODY IDS:
- Explicitly list any request-body fields that look like identifiers or foreign keys (e.g., names ending with "id"/"Id"/"ID", or described as identifiers/UUIDs, or $ref to another schema).
- State whether such IDs are enumerated (enum) or unconstrained references.
- If the ID refers to external/unknown resources (not enumerable, large/unknown domain), call out that generation SHOULD use "%not-sure%" for valid (2xx) happy-path cases unless examples/enum/small-range are provided.

An example of a nicely written and detailed constraint is as follows:
- To create a difficult password, you can use a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and make sure the password is not too short."""

GET_DATASET_PROMPT = """Given below information about the endpoint, you will create a dataset {amount_instruction} about the {part} of the endpoint, to be used for testing the endpoint.

{additional_instruction}

You MUST follow this validation policy WHEN SETTING "expected_code":
- If ANY provided field (non-null/non-missing) violates the {part}'s specification (minimum/maximum, enum, pattern, format, required, parseability for path/query, etc.), then "expected_code" MUST be "4xx".
- Only when ALL provided fields satisfy the {part}'s specification, "expected_code" MUST be "2xx".
- Missing optional fields are allowed and should still lead to "2xx" unless the spec says otherwise.
- For JSON bodies (or typed payloads), strict type mismatches (e.g., string vs integer) are violations → "4xx".
- For PATH/QUERY parameters, treat "type" as PARSEABILITY + FORMAT/PATTERN.
  • Do NOT mark 4xx merely because a value is quoted vs unquoted in the URL.
  • Use non-parseable tokens to test type violations (e.g., integer="abc", boolean="tru"), or use format/pattern/enum violations.
- If the spec allows nullable for a field, providing null is acceptable for that field.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT assume database existence checks. Judge correctness solely by the schema/specification (types, enums, ranges, formats, patterns, required).

CRITICAL PATH PARAMETER RULES (if {part} contains path parameters):
- PATH PARAMETERS (in: "path") are NEVER nullable and ALWAYS required by OpenAPI spec.
- PATH PARAMETERS MUST ALWAYS have a non-null, non-empty value in EVERY test case.
- FORBIDDEN for path parameters: null, "", undefined, missing from data object.
- PATH PARAMETERS must satisfy their schema constraints (type, minimum, maximum, pattern, etc.).

PATH PARAMETER VALUE ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:
First ANALYZE each path parameter's specification to determine if concrete values can be reliably inferred:

CRITERIA FOR USING CONCRETE VALUES (for 2XX cases):
✅ Parameter has ENUM values → Use values from the enum
✅ Parameter has BOTH minimum AND maximum with small range (≤100) → Use values within range
✅ Parameter has clear examples provided in spec → Use or derive similar values
✅ Parameter has specific format constraints (date, uuid, etc.) → Generate valid format values
✅ If the param has only broad/basic type and no additional constraints, provide a syntactically valid and reasonably realistic value per its type/format (do not rely on DB existence).

BODY ID-LIKE FIELD RULES (applies when {part} is "body" or includes a JSON payload):
- ID-like detection heuristics (use all that apply):
  • Field name matches /(.*_)?(id|Id|ID)$/ (e.g., userId, product_id, id).
  • Field description mentions "identifier", "id", "UUID/uid", or refers to another resource/entity.
  • Schema is a $ref to another object where that object or its parent clearly acts as a foreign reference.
  • Arrays of references (e.g., itemIds: string[]/integer[]) are also ID-like.
- When an ID-like field is an ENUM → use concrete enum values for 2xx cases.
- When an ID-like field has a tight bounded numeric range (both minimum & maximum and ≤100 values) → use a concrete in-range value for 2xx.
- Otherwise (large/unknown domain, no examples): for **2xx** dataset rows, provide a syntactically valid value per the field's type/format (e.g., a well-formed UUID for uuid fields, a positive integer within typical bounds for integer IDs). Do NOT assume or test database existence in 2xx cases.
- For **4xx** rows on body IDs: use concrete **invalid but non-null** values (e.g., wrong format/UUID, out-of-range number, enum miss, pattern violation).

TRANSPORT-LEVEL RULES for PATH/QUERY parameters:
- All values are sent as text; servers parse them back.
- Integer/number tests:
  • Valid: values that parse as numbers and satisfy bounds.
  • Invalid (4xx): non-parseable tokens ("abc", "12x"), or out-of-range numbers.
- Boolean tests:
  • Valid: "true"/"false" (lowercase), unless spec explicitly allows others (e.g., 1/0).
  • Invalid (4xx): non-boolean tokens like "tru", "yes" when not allowed.
- Enum tests:
  • Valid: a member of allowed set.
  • Invalid (4xx): any value outside the set.
- Do NOT rely on quoted vs unquoted to trigger 4xx in path/query.

FOR 4XX CASES (testing validation):
- Always use INVALID but NON-NULL concrete values to test constraints
- Examples (path/query): non-parseable tokens for numeric/boolean; outside enum; pattern/format violations; out-of-range values
- Examples (body): wrong JSON type; out-of-range; enum/pattern/format violations; format(UUID/date) mismatch
- NEVER use null or empty string for path parameter validation testing

Additionally, you must strictly follow these rules to create the dataset file:
- The data will be generated based on real-world data as much as possible.
- The generated test data must be in the JSONL format.
- Each JSON object MUST have EXACTLY these keys: "data", "expected_code", "reason".
  - "data": object that only contains fields allowed by the {part}'s spec.
  - "expected_code": either "2xx" or "4xx" per the above policy.
  - "reason": write in plain, human-readable English (no URL encoding, no escape sequences, no prefixes). Be concise but explicit:
      * Name the rule/constraint (minimum, maximum, enum, type, required, format/pattern).
      * Quote the offending field/value if "4xx".
      * Examples (schema-agnostic):
        - "NUMBER_FIELD is within [MIN..MAX]; ENUM_FIELD is within its allowed set."
        - "NUMBER_FIELD={{VALUE}} > maximum={{MAX}}, violating 'maximum'."
        - "ENUM_FIELD='{{BAD_VALUE}}' is not in enum {{ALLOWED_ENUM}}."
        - "FIELD is required but missing, violating 'required'."
        - "PATH_PARAM='{{VALUE}}' is in the allowed enum {{ENUM_VALUES}}."
        - "PATH_PARAM={{VALUE}} is within allowed range [{{MIN}}..{{MAX}}]."
        - "PATH_PARAM='{{BAD_VALUE}}' is not in the allowed enum {{ENUM_VALUES}}."
        - "PATH_PARAM={{VALUE}} violates {{CONSTRAINT}} constraint."
        - "QUERY_PARAM='{{RAW}}' is not parseable as integer (type=parseability), violating 'type=integer'."
        - "FIELD='{{RAW}}' does not match format {{EXPECTED_FORMAT}}."

- DO NOT add any additional fields that are not specified in the endpoint's specification.
- ONLY generate the data based on the {part}'s specification.
- Avoid excessively large values (very long strings, very large numbers). If you need a large integer, use 2147483649; for a long string, cap at 257 characters.

Given information:
<begin>
Data from Swagger Spec:
{endpoint_data}
{ref_data}
</end>
{additional_context}

⚠️  CRITICAL WARNING for PATH PARAMETERS: NEVER generate test cases with null, empty string (""), or missing path parameters. Path parameters MUST ALWAYS have values.

ANALYSIS EXAMPLES for path parameter decision-making:
• provinceId with enum ["AB","BC","MB"...] → Use concrete values like "AB", "MB" for 2xx cases
• holidayId with minimum=1, maximum=34 → Use concrete values like 1, 15, 34 for 2xx cases
• billId with only basic integer type and no additional constraints → Use a realistic positive integer like 100123 for 2xx cases (judge by type/format, not DB existence)
• userId with format=uuid and no enum → Use a well-formed UUID (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000") for 2xx

BODY ID EXAMPLES (apply same logic to request body fields):
• userId (string, format=uuid, no enum) → for 2xx use a well-formed UUID; for 4xx use "not-a-uuid" to violate format.
• product_id (integer, minimum=1 only) → for 2xx use a positive integer like 1001; for 4xx use 0 to violate minimum.
• roleId (enum ["admin","editor","viewer"]) → for 2xx use an enum value; for 4xx use "owner".
• itemIds (array of integer IDs, unconstrained) → for 2xx use [101, 202]; for 4xx use ["abc"] to violate type/parseability.

Note: The dataset is created for {part} only. First, briefly write "Approach: ..." describing how you selected fields and constraints. Then provide the dataset in JSONL between triple backticks.

Correctness rules (MUST FOLLOW; schema-agnostic):
- Numeric field outside its [minimum..maximum] per spec → "4xx", explain which bound is violated and show provided vs bound.
- Enum field with a value not in the allowed set → "4xx", show the provided value and the allowed set.
- Type/format/pattern mismatch in JSON body → "4xx", cite the exact spec keyword (type/format/pattern).
- PATH/QUERY type violations are about parseability (e.g., integer="abc", boolean="tru"), not quoting.
- Missing required field → "4xx", cite 'required'.
- Path parameter with valid concrete value (enum member or within range) → "2xx", cite the validation.
- Path parameter with null, empty string, or missing value → FORBIDDEN (never generate these cases).
- Otherwise (all provided fields satisfy constraints) → "2xx".

Format example (JSONL; schema-agnostic):
```json
{{
  "data": {{ "NUMBER_FIELD": 123, "ENUM_FIELD": "ok" }},
  "expected_code": "2xx",
  "reason": "NUMBER_FIELD is within its allowed range; ENUM_FIELD matches the allowed enum {{ALLOWED_ENUM}}."
